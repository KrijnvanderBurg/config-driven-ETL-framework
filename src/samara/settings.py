    Provides centralized configuration management for the Samara framework.

    Attributes:
        log_level: Logging level for the application (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING,
            ERROR, CRITICAL). Defaults to INFO if not specified via
            SAMARA_LOG_LEVEL environment variable.
        trace_parent: W3C Trace Context traceparent for distributed tracing.
            Loaded from SAMARA_TRACE_PARENT environment variable if set.
        trace_state: W3C Trace Context tracestate for distributed tracing.
            Loaded from SAMARA_TRACE_STATE environment variable if set.
        otlp_endpoint: OTLP endpoint for exporting traces, e.g., "localhost:4317".
            Loaded from SAMARA_OTLP_ENDPOINT environment variable if set.

    Note:
        Settings are cached using lru_cache, so the singleton instance is
        created once and reused. To reload settings after environment changes,
        call `get_settings.cache_clear()` first.

    Returns a cached AppSettings instance, creating it on first call and

    configuration access throughout the application lifecycle.

    Returns:
        The singleton AppSettings instance with all configuration loaded
        from environment variables and validated.

    Example:
        >>> from samara.settings import get_settings
        >>> settings = get_settings()
        >>> print(settings.log_level)
        INFO

    Note:
        The lru_cache decorator with no maxsize creates a singleton pattern,
        ensuring only one settings instance exists during the application
        lifecycle. This is thread-safe and efficient.
