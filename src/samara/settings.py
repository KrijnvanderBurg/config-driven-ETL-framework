"""Application settings - Centralized configuration management.

This module provides a singleton-based settings management system using Pydantic
BaseSettings. Settings can be loaded from environment variables and accessed
globally throughout the application with automatic caching and validation.

    """Application-wide settings loaded from environment variables.

    Provides centralized configuration management for the Samara framework.
    Settings are automatically loaded from environment variables with the
    SAMARA_ prefix and cached for efficient access throughout the application.

    Attributes:
        log_level: Logging level for the application (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING,
            ERROR, CRITICAL). Defaults to INFO if not specified via
            SAMARA_LOG_LEVEL environment variable.
        environment: Deployment environment identifier (dev, staging, prod).
            Defaults to "unknown" if not specified via SAMARA_ENVIRONMENT
            environment variable. Used for telemetry and resource attribution.
        trace_parent: W3C Trace Context traceparent for distributed tracing.
            Loaded from SAMARA_TRACE_PARENT environment variable if set.
        trace_state: W3C Trace Context tracestate for distributed tracing.
            Loaded from SAMARA_TRACE_STATE environment variable if set.
        otlp_traces_endpoint: OTLP endpoint for exporting traces. Supports any
            OTLP-compatible backend:
            - OTEL Collector (recommended): "https://otel-collector:4318/v1/traces"
            - Direct to Jaeger: "https://jaeger:4318/v1/traces"
            - Any OTLP HTTP endpoint
            Loaded from SAMARA_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT environment variable if set.
        otlp_logs_endpoint: OTLP endpoint for exporting logs. Supports any
            OTLP-compatible backend:
            - OTEL Collector (recommended): "https://otel-collector:4318/v1/logs"
            - Direct to Loki: "https://loki:3100/loki/api/v1/push"
            - Any OTLP HTTP endpoint
            Loaded from SAMARA_OTLP_LOGS_ENDPOINT environment variable if set.

    Note:
        Settings are cached using lru_cache, so the singleton instance is
        created once and reused. To reload settings after environment changes,
        call `get_settings.cache_clear()` first.

    """Retrieve the singleton application settings instance.

    Returns a cached AppSettings instance, creating it on first call and
    reusing the same instance for subsequent calls. This ensures consistent
    configuration access throughout the application lifecycle.

    Returns:
        The singleton AppSettings instance with all configuration loaded
        from environment variables and validated.

    Example:
        >>> from samara.settings import get_settings
        >>> settings = get_settings()
        >>> print(settings.log_level)
        INFO

    Note:
        The lru_cache decorator with no maxsize creates a singleton pattern,

        lifecycle. This is thread-safe and efficient.
