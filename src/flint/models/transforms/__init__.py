"""Configuration models for transformation functions in the ingestion framework.

This package contains model classes that define the configuration schema
for various transformation operations supported by the framework.

Each transformation function has its own model module that defines:
- The expected configuration parameters
- Type definitions for transformation arguments
- Constants for configuration key names
- Validation and conversion functions

These models serve as the interface between configuration files and
the transformation implementation code.
