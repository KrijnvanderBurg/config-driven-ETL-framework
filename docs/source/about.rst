About PySpark Ingestion Framework
=============================

PySpark Ingestion Framework is a scalable, configuration-driven ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) framework built on Apache PySpark. It is designed for data engineers, data scientists, and developers who need to create robust data pipelines without extensive coding.

Core Features
------------

- **Configuration-Driven**: Create and configure entire ETL pipelines using JSON configuration files
- **Modular Architecture**: Pluggable components for extraction, transformation, and loading operations
- **Type Safety**: Leverages Python type hints throughout the codebase for robust design
- **Extensibility**: Register custom components through decorator patterns
- **Streaming Support**: Handles both batch and streaming data workflows
- **Schema Management**: Built-in schema handling for data validation and consistency

Use Cases
---------

- **Data Integration**: Consolidate data from multiple sources into a unified format
- **Data Transformation**: Apply complex transformations to data using PySpark's distributed computing capabilities
- **Data Warehousing**: Load processed data into data warehouses and data lakes
- **Real-time Analytics**: Process streaming data for near real-time insights
- **Data Migration**: Move data between different storage systems while applying transformations

Architecture
-----------

The framework follows a classic ETL pattern with three main component types:

1. **Extract**: Components that read data from various sources (databases, files, APIs)
2. **Transform**: Components that modify and process data using PySpark operations
3. **Load**: Components that write processed data to target destinations

The Job class orchestrates these components, ensuring they execute in the correct sequence.
