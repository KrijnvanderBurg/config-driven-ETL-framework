# Python DevContainer - Complete Code Quality Suite

A development environment with 20+ integrated code quality tools, automated CI/CD validation, and zero-configuration setup. This DevContainer provides everything you need for professional Python development: formatters, linters, type checkers, security scanners, dependency analyzers, test runners, and documentation generators.

## 🚀 Why Use This DevContainer?

### Zero-Configuration Professional Development Environment
DevContainers provide a fully configured and isolated development environment inside a container, ensuring consistent, reproducible, and platform-independent setup across your entire team. No more "works on my machine" issues or lengthy environment setup procedures.

### Comprehensive Tool Integration
This DevContainer includes 20+ carefully curated industry-standard Python development tools:

- **🎨 Code Formatters**: Ruff - Ensure consistent code style across your team
- **🔍 Linters & Analyzers**: Pylint, Flake8, Ruff Linter - Catch bugs and enforce best practices
- **🔒 Type Checkers**: Mypy, Pyright, Pylance - Prevent type-related errors before workflow
- **🛡️ Security Scanners**: Bandit, Semgrep - Identify vulnerabilities and security issues
- **🔐 Secret Detection**: TruffleHog - Prevent credential leaks in your repository
- **🧪 Testing & Coverage**: Pytest with Coverage.py - Ensure code reliability and test completeness
- **📚 Documentation**: Sphinx - Generate professional documentation automatically

### Two Modes of Operation

#### Primary: Real-time Code Analysis (Opened Files)
Extensions provide instant feedback as you code, showing issues directly in the editor and Problems tab for the currently open file.

!["Preview of live problems tab showing issues"](./docs/preview_live_problems_tab.gif)

Code Coverage can be seen directly in the editor after running tests. The `if` line shows orange for partially covered by unit tests and the `print` line shows red for not covered.

### Quick Setup

**Launch**: Open project in VS Code → `F1` → "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"

### Architecture Benefits

This implementation uses Docker Compose for maximum flexibility:
- **Main Container**: Development environment with all tools pre-installed
- **Extensible**: Easy to add supporting services (databases, message queues, etc.)
- **Volume Mounts**: Persistent storage for workspace and configuration
- **Package Caching**: Docker volumes cache pip and Poetry packages for fast rebuilds.
- **Platform Independent**: Consistent experience across Windows, macOS, and Linux

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed and running
- [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) for VS Code

### Quick Installation

1. **📥 Clone This Example Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KrijnvanderBurg/DevOps-Toolkit
   cd DevOps-Toolkit
   ```

2. **📦 Initialize Submodules** (Required):
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
   
   **Why `--recursive`?** The `.devcontainer/.dotfiles` directory is a git submodule from another repository. This ensures all configuration files and scripts are properly downloaded. If you create a submodule of this devcontainer then its a nested submodule. 

3. **🐳 Launch Container**: Open project in VS Code, press `F1` → "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"

4. **⚡ Verify Setup**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Tasks: Run Task" → "test" (all tools should pass on a fresh project)

### Architecture Notes

- **Nested Repository Structure**: The `.devcontainer/.dotfiles` is a git submodule containing all tool configurations and scripts as a self-contained unit
- **Why Submodule**: This approach keeps the DevContainer configuration portable and reusable across multiple projects while maintaining version control over the development environment setup

> **🚀 Ready for production deployment?** This DevContainer uses identical configurations as the [Azure DevOps CI/CD templates](https://github.com/KrijnvanderBurg/.azuredevops). Your local quality checks **mirror your pipeline exactly** — when tests pass locally, they're guaranteed to pass in production.

**Pro Tips:**
- Run `test` task before committing to catch issues early
- Use individual tool tasks for focused debugging  
- Check the Problems panel for real-time feedback on open files
- Generated reports (`coverage.xml`, `JUNIT-TEST.xml`) provide detailed analysis

## 📊 Code Coverage Visualization

The DevContainer includes visual code coverage display that works with both VS Code's built-in test runner and task-based testing. Below shows an if statement being only partially covered by tests. The `if` line shows orange for partially covered by unit tests and the `print` line shows red for not covered.

![Preview Code Coverage in Editor](./docs/preview_coverage_in_editor.gif)

### How Coverage Works

Both testing methods generate a `coverage.xml` file in the workspace root:

- **VS Code UI Tests**: Run tests via the Testing panel (sidebar) → automatically generates `coverage.xml`
- **VS Code Tasks**: Run `pytest and coverage` task → generates `coverage.xml` and `JUNIT-TEST.xml`

### Coverage Gutter Extension

Visual code coverage display shows covered/uncovered lines directly in editor gutters.

**Setup:**
1. Run tests with coverage using either method above
2. Open Command Palette: `Ctrl+Shift+P`
3. Run: "Coverage Gutter: Display Coverage"
4. **Enable Watch Mode**: "Coverage Gutter: Watch" for automatic updates when `coverage.xml` changes

**Benefits:**
- **Real-time Feedback**: See coverage immediately after running tests
- **Visual Indicators**: Green (covered), red (uncovered), yellow (partial) line highlighting
- **Automatic Updates**: Watch mode refreshes coverage when you re-run tests

**Troubleshooting:**
- Ensure `coverage.xml` is generated in workspace root
- Check `.coveragerc` configuration if coverage isn't working
- Verify pytest is configured with coverage in `pytest.ini`

## 🔧 VS Code Tasks - Complete CI/CD Pipeline Integration

This DevContainer includes a comprehensive task automation system that mirrors your CI/CD pipeline, allowing you to validate your entire codebase locally before pushing to remote repositories.

### Why Use Tasks?

**Repository-Wide Analysis**: Unlike live editor feedback (limited to open files), tasks scan your entire codebase for comprehensive validation.  
**Pre-Push Confidence**: Catch issues locally using the same tools and configurations as your production CI/CD pipeline.  
**Parallel Execution**: Independent tasks can run simultaneously for faster feedback.

!["Run all Code Quality tools as VSCode Tasks"](./docs/run_all_vscode_tasks.gif)

### How to Run Tasks

**Command Palette**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → `"Tasks: Run Task"` → Select task  
**Terminal Menu**: `Terminal` → `Run Task...`

### Available Tasks

#### 🏗️ Build Tasks
- **poetry lock**: Lock dependencies
- **poetry install**: Install dependencies  
- **build package**: Create Python wheel
- **install package**: Install the built package

#### ✅ Test Tasks  
- **sphinx build docs**: Generate documentation
- **ruff formatter**: Format code with Ruff
- **ruff linter**: Lint with Ruff
- **pylint**: Lint with Pylint
- **flake8**: Lint with Flake8
- **mypy**: Type check with MyPy
- **pyright**: Type check with Pyright
- **bandit**: Security scan with Bandit
- **semgrep**: Security scan with Semgrep
- **trufflehog**: Secret detection

### Results & Output
- **Terminal Panels**: Each task runs in a dedicated terminal
- **Error Indicator**: Red text with ❌ for failures
- **Generated Reports**: `coverage.xml`, `JUNIT-TEST.xml` in workspace root

### Technical Implementation

All tasks execute shell scripts from `.devcontainer/.dotfiles/python/scripts/` using centralized configuration files. This ensures consistency between local development and CI/CD environments.

### Configuration File Paths

All tools reference centralized configuration files:
```
.devcontainer/.dotfiles/python/
└── scripts/              # Execution scripts
    ├── ruff_formatter.sh
    ├── pylint.sh
    └── ...
├── ruff.toml            # Ruff configuration
├── mypy.ini             # MyPy type checker settings
├── pytest.ini           # Pytest configuration
├── ...
```

### Adding New Tasks

To add a new tool:

1. **Add configuration**: Create tool config file in `.dotfiles/`
2. **Create script**: Add execution script to `.dotfiles/.../scripts/` directory
3. **Define task**: Add task definition to `devcontainer.json`
4. **Update dependencies**: Add to appropriate task chain

### Task Debugging

For troubleshooting task execution:
- Check script permissions (`chmod +x`)
- Verify file paths and variable substitution
- Test scripts manually in terminal
- Review task output in dedicated terminal panels

This comprehensive task system provides a robust foundation for maintaining code quality and ensuring CI/CD pipeline compatibility.

## ⚙️ Platform Configuration

#### Git Configuration (Recommended)
Add the following lines to `.gitattributes` file in project root. This prevents git from thinking ALL files changed due to different line endings when opening devcontainer from Windows machines:
```bash
* text=auto
*.sh text eol=lf
*.conf text eol=lf
```

#### WSL2 Resource Limits (Optional)
Dev containers use WSL2 on Windows, which can consume significant resources. You can define limits in `.wslconfig` and place it at `C:\Users\<username>\.wslconfig`:

```ini
[wsl2]
# Limits VM memory to use no more than 6 GB
memory=6GB 
# Sets the VM to use four virtual processors
processors=4
# Sets amount of swap storage space to 8GB, default is 25% of available RAM
swap=8GB
# Enable page reporting so WSL releases memory back to Windows when free
pageReporting=true
```
